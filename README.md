## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I further polished my knowledge in css by importing font successfully 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.@font-face {
    font-family: 'Outfit';
    src: url('./Caveat,Outfit/Outfit-VariableFont_wght.ttf') format('truetype');
    /* You can include additional font formats (e.g., woff, woff2) for better browser compatibility */
}

body {
    font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif; 
}


If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I look forward to improving my knowledge in custom css and improving readability of my code

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-flexbox/) - This helped me with positioning of divs and other css customizations. I really liked the information and study guide provided by this site and will use it going forward.
- [Resource 2](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-intro-to-css) - This is an amazing website with tons of resources and practice guides which helped me finally understand html tags. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
